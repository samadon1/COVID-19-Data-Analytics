# COVID-19-Data-Analytics

## Scenario 
I am a junior data analyst working for the World Health Organization (WHO). I have been at my job for six months, then the Coronavirus pandemic hit. Working with 194 Member States, across six regions, and from more than 150 offices, WHO staff are united in a shared commitment to achieve better health for everyone, everywhere. I have been asked to lead the COVID-19 project — this involves presenting data-driven recommendations on the best way to prevent and slow down transmission of the disease. I will ask the right questions, ensure the data’s integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and prepare a presentation.

## Ask Phase
•	Problem Statement (Who, Where, What, When):
As of January 2020, over 3.5 million people and counting have died from the COVID-19 pandemic from all over the world.
The business task requires that I find the best way to help prevent and slow down transmission of the disease.

What is the Problem type (Making predictions, categorizing things, spotting something unusual, identifying themes, discovering connections, finding patterns)
### •	Asking SMART questions
What is the mortality risk of COVID-19 – the likelihood that someone who is infected with the disease will die from it?
Does the disease affect certain demographics more than others? If so, which people are more likely to get severely ill and die from the disease?
What percentage of a country’s population is infected with Covid-19?

Hypothesis: COVID-19 cases are increasing and people with pre-existing conditions are most at risk of death.
Why? Why? Why?
